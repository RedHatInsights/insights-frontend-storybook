# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs in cloud.redhat.com should follow these guidelines:

* Pages that are directly off the left nav do not have breadcrumbs
* The left-nav item should be the root of the breadcrumb
* If the left-nav is the parent of 2 different objects,  can use the parent as parent both times (Will clarify, TBD)

## Examples
