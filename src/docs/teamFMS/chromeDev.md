# Developing with local chrome

## Prerequisites

1. Have insights-chrome cloned
2. Have insights-proxy cloned
    * Make sure to run the update.sh script and have your hosts set up
3.Have an application cloned

## Building Chrome

To build chrome, you can run `npm run build` to build the entire project once or `npm run watch` to watch changes across all files and rebuild after every save.

## Proxy Flag

The `LOCAL_CHROME=true` flag lets developers set insights-proxy to use a local version of insights-chrome instead of the version that is on ci-beta.

Your full command should look something like:

```sh
SPANDX_CONFIG=../../insights-frontend-starter-app/profiles/local-frontend.js LOCAL_CHROME=true sh ../../insights-proxy/scripts/run.sh
```

Note: Different apps use different profiles. Because of this, your spandx_config file might be different than `local-frontend.js`.

## Local Storage

### Debugging with logs

In your browser console, you can set `localStorage.setItem('chrome:jwt:debug', true);` to get the log and debugging messages. These are hidden by default.

When you input the command, you will get an undefined message. Ignore this and refresh the page.

### Keycloak Short Session

There is also a short-session for Keycloak that will time out your session in 2 minutes instead of 15 minutes. To activate it, set `localStorage.setItem('chrome:jwt:shortSession, true);` in your browser console.

## Build Everything

You need a terminal with 3 tabs that are running these commands:

1. `npm run build` or `npm run watch` in insights-chrome
2. `npm run start` in the app directory (in this case, itâ€™s the starter app)
3. `SPANDX_CONFIG` pointing to your local frontend and the insights-proxy run script
