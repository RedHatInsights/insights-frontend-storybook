# cloud.redhat.com Storybook

The Insights Storybook is a place for Insights documentation regarding front end development through the chroming, components, and any applications.

## [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)

Storybook is a development environment for UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.

### Addons

Addons are essentially plugins for Storybook that allow a deeper configuration.

These are the addons that are currently supported in this storybook:

* [ReadMe](https://github.com/tuchk4/storybook-readme) -
    Storybook Community Addon ReadMe gives the ability to import markdown docs in the main story and in the Addon Panel.

* [Knobs](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/release/3.4/addons/knobs) -
    Allows you to edit React props dynamically using the Storybook UI. You can also use Knobs as a dynamic variable inside stories in Storybook.

* [Chapters](https://github.com/Checkfront/react-storybook-addon-chapters) -
    Allows showcasing of multiple components within a story by breaking down the story into smaller categories (chapters) and subcategories (sections) for better organization.

### Navigating Storybook & Terms

#### Addon Panel
