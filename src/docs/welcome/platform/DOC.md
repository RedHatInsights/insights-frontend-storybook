# The Platform and how it works

## Chrome

Chrome (or Insights Chrome) is the "wrapper" around your application. At the moment, Chrome does a lot of thigs for the platform:

- Serves the sidenav (generated by the source of truth) & routes accordingly - injected with ESI tags
- Serves the masthead - injected with ESI tags
- Authenticates with Keycloakjs
- Window functions
- Inventory Component
- CSS Variables

![Example of Chrome:](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-frontend-storybook/blob/master/src/docs/welcome/img/chrome.png?raw=true)

## The Source of Truth

The source of truth is where all of the platform's applications are listed along with their sub applications, deployment repos, and pathing.

There is a `main.yml` file that is referenced in every environment as a branch in the [Cloud Services Config repository](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/cloud-services-config).

Examples:

- [prod-stable](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/cloud-services-config/blob/prod-stable/main.yml)
- [ci-beta](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/cloud-services-config/blob/ci-beta/main.yml)

## Proxy

The Proxy (or Insights Proxy) is a container that uses [Spandx](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/spandx) which provides ESI tags. This allows the sidenav and masthead from chrome to get injected and also allows routing between apps.

Developers can pass custom spanx config files
